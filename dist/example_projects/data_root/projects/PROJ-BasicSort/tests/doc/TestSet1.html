    <p>Test set contains 95 test cases with the arrays of 
    sizes 100 to 1000 (step 50). For each size test set contains 5 
    different test cases. </p>
    This test set is used to show the differences between fast (n log n) and 
    slow (n^2) algorithms. In the Quick info tab above it is clearly seen that the
    BubbleSort and the Insertion sort algorithms tend to be slow while the
    QuickSort and the JavaSort are fast.
