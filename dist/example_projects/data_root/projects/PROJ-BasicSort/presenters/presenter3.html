For sorting already sorted arrays the Insertion sort performs only a linear number
of operation, therefore it is not surprising that it is better than both quick sort
algorithms. The results that we can not explaint are those of sorting relatively small 
arrays (from 10.000 to 13.000). Here the Insertion sort is also slow. Why?
