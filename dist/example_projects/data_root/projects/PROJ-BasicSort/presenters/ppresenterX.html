In this graph, there are presented the results of all the algorithms on the TestSet1.  The fast algorithms (QuickSort and JavaSort) sorted an array of 1000 elements in less than 100 microseconds while the slowest algorithm (Bubble sort) needed allmost 1000 micro seconds. For detailed results see the web page of each 
algorithm.
