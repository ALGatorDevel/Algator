In this graph there are presented the results of executing the basic and the 
Strassen's algorithm.  For the basic algorithm, the time is cubic \( \Theta(n^3) \), 
which can be also clearly seen from the graph. For the Strassen algorithm, however, 
the time looks to be constant on selected intervals (like from n=260 to n=510) than
it "jumps" on the next level.
